### Readme for Project 2

# This project contains: 
- `start.m`: the main function which contains examples of: 
   - how to load the data 
   - a classification using LDA with Matlab's inbuilt tools
   - visualizations of the classification
- `my_fitcdiscr.m`: Get the Wstar for test dataset 
- `my_predict.m`: The function for finding the class labels from a set of features
- `fisher_projection.m`: Find the Fisher projection using the training features and labels and train a classifier to the Fisher projected training data.
- `classifier_KNN`:  The function for finding the class labels from a set of features
- `visualizeBoundaries.m`: a function to visualize the linear discriminant boundaries in two dimensions
- `visualizeBoundariesFill.m`: a function to visualize the classification areas both linear discriminant and fisher's projection in two dimensions and

Whatever you want run start.m and follow the instructions it mentions.
